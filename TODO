Inherit eclasses. (Keep in mind that an eclass can inherit more eclasses.)

Implement a system that keeps track of how many unused files there are (seem
to be) on a regular basis, and makes plots of it. Weekly updates would be nice.
If I make plots like this, I'll have to put a big red line to mark each change
to the program--otherwise it might look like a huge change in the number of
unused files.

Replace optparse? optparse is deprecated, to be replaced by argparse. If they
ever set a removal date for optparse, I'll make the change.

Consider changing this:
./filesdir-check --dir=/usr/local/portage --verbose gcc
CHECKING TREE AT '/usr/local/portage'...
        Checking 'sys-devel/gcc'...
                It has no 'files' directory.
We could report back that there is no 'sys-devel/gcc' in that tree when
appropriate.
