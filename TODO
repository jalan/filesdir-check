Handle these commonly used variables: MY_P, MY_PN, MY_PV. Here are options:
 - pattern matching (ugh)
 - partially sourcing ebuilds
 - qiaomuf's libbash?

Inherit eclasses. (Keep in mind that an eclass can inherit more eclasses.)

Migrate from optparse (deprecated) to argparse.

There's some clean up to do now that --verbose is gone.
