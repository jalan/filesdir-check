Handle these commonly used variables: MY_P, MY_PN, MY_PV. Here are options:
 - pattern matching (ugh)
 - partially sourcing ebuilds
 - qiaomuf's libbash?

Inherit eclasses. (Keep in mind that an eclass can inherit more eclasses.)

Replace optparse? optparse is deprecated, to be replaced by argparse. If they
ever set a removal date for optparse, I'll make the change.

Consider changing this:
./filesdir-check --dir=/usr/local/portage --verbose gcc
CHECKING TREE AT '/usr/local/portage'...
        Checking 'sys-devel/gcc'...
                It has no 'files' directory.
We could report back that there is no 'sys-devel/gcc' in that tree when
appropriate.
