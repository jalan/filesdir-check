Inherit eclasses. This could get ugly, since an eclass can inherit more
eclasses. It may be best to dive into the portage internals in order to tackle
this one. I imagine there's a function in there somewhere that does inherits.

Ignore comments in ebuilds. If a file is only mentioned in a comment, it
probably shouldn't be around anymore.

Implement a system that keeps track of how many unused files there are (seem
to be) on a regular basis, and makes plots of it. Weekly updates would be nice.
If I make plots like this, I'll have to put a big red line to mark each change
to the program--otherwise it might look like a huge change in the number of
unused files.

Allow limited checking: specify categories and/or cat/package on the command
line.

Add options to check portdir only, overlays only, or both. It wouldn't be hard
to check portdir_overlay as well, but I don't know if that covers layman
overlays. maybe layman uses portdir_overlay too? space-delimited list of dirs.
Here's some code to start with
parser.add_option("-o", "--overlays",
                  action="store_true", dest="overlays", default=False,
                  help="Check overlays instead of the main tree. Each entry in PORTDIR_OVERLAY will be checked individually.")

Replace optparse: use argparse for python 2.7 and later. I'll probably do this
around the time that it becomes no longer necessary to have python 2.6 on a
stable gentoo system.
